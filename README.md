# Pascal

**AI tutor that answers from course materials and enforces each class's honor code.**

TreeHacks 2026 · Built in 36 hours · Team of 4 · Forked from [danielmargento/pigeonhole](https://github.com/danielmargento/pigeonhole)

## Highlights

- Led a 4-person team to ship an AI tutor in 36 hours that gives real help without handing out answers
- Gave instructors control of help levels per assignment (Strict, Guided, Full Support) and the option to block final answers or full code
- Grounded every answer in course materials with RAG over OpenAI embeddings and Supabase vector search, with clickable citations
- Built at TreeHacks 2026, where about 1,000 hackers were admitted from 15,000+ applicants

## Built with

TypeScript · Next.js · Tailwind CSS · Supabase · OpenAI API

## My role

Led the team from idea to working demo.

## 💡 Why Pascal?

Most AI tools treat education as an afterthought. Students paste a homework problem into ChatGPT and get a full solution. They learn nothing. Teachers have no visibility or control.

Pascal flips this:

- 🧑‍🏫 **Teacher in the loop.** Instructors set the rules — help level, allowed artifacts, topic restrictions, staff notes — and the bot follows them. The teacher decides whether students get Socratic questioning, guided hints, or full tutoring. Not the AI.
- 🔒 **Integrity first.** The default is restrictive. No answers, no full code, attempt required first. Teachers opt *in* to more permissive modes when appropriate. The bot enforces academic integrity by design, not as an afterthought.
- 📄 **Scoped to real course materials.** Pascal only knows what the teacher gives it — syllabi, lecture notes, problem sets. It doesn't hallucinate references to materials that don't exist. When general chat is enabled, it's limited to teacher-selected documents.
- 📌 **Assignment-aware.** Each assignment can have its own help level, anchor document, staff notes, and annotated hints. When a student asks about "question 4," the bot knows exactly which document to look in.

## ✨ Features

### 🛠 For Instructors

- **Course creation** with join codes for student enrollment
- **Three help levels** per assignment: Strict (confirmation only), Guided (Socratic hints), Full Support (complete tutoring after effort shown)
- **Policy guardrails** — toggle final answers, full code, require-attempt-first, allowed/disallowed artifacts
- **Topic gating** — mark topics as "not yet taught," "allowed," or "warn" to prevent the bot from spoiling upcoming material
- **Staff notes** — private per-assignment instructions the bot follows but never reveals to students
- **Anchor documents** — designate one material as THE assignment doc so the bot knows where to look for question numbers
- **PDF annotations** — highlight specific passages in uploaded PDFs with private hints for the bot
- **General chat control** — disabled by default; teachers enable it and select exactly which materials (e.g. syllabus) the bot can reference
- **Course materials** — upload PDFs, text files, and markdown; extracted text is chunked and embedded for RAG retrieval
- **Usage insights** — see which assignments get the most questions, top topics, common misconceptions (LLM-summarized)
- **Announcements** — post messages visible to enrolled students
- **Roster management** — view enrolled students
- **Student view preview** — see exactly what students see

### 🎒 For Students

- **Assignment-aware chat** — select an assignment and get help scoped to that specific problem set and its materials
- **Concept check quizzes** — inline multiple-choice questions after explanations to reinforce learning (toggleable)
- **Clickable source citations** — bot responses link back to specific pages/sections of course materials
- **Save and bookmark** helpful messages during a session
- **Export to PDF** — save threads or snippets for offline review or forum sharing
- **Session history** — resume past conversations per assignment
- **Feedback** — rate responses as helpful, not helpful, or too revealing
- **LaTeX and Markdown** rendering for math-heavy courses

### ⚙️ Under the Hood

- **RAG retrieval** — course materials are chunked, embedded, and searched via vector similarity so the bot references real content, not hallucinations
- **Anchor boosting** — chunks from the designated assignment document get a similarity boost and a guaranteed secondary search fallback
- **Anti-hallucination prompting** — the bot is explicitly forbidden from inventing lecture names, chapter titles, or any references not present in its provided materials
- **Per-assignment policy overrides** — each assignment can override the course-level help policy
- **Streaming responses** via SSE for real-time chat
- **Question hint matching** — the bot detects when students reference specific questions and applies instructor-provided hints

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router) + TypeScript
- **TailwindCSS**
- **Supabase** (Postgres + Auth + Storage)
- **OpenAI API** (GPT-4o-mini for chat, text-embedding-3-small for RAG)
